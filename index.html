        <div class='date'>First off, I'm sorry, but I just don't get this stuff, my mind doesn't work this way. As far as the assignments go, the Genre Analasys is probably middle road I guess.</div>
        <div class='signup'>I gotta say, I can definitely say that I don't like coding. It was cool for the first five seconds, and then it was just not my thing. As for the Group Project, I think I will be putting that at a higher road.</div>
        <div class='login'>And finally, the stand alone project. I'll say middle or high road. Though I'm still rather confused about how that is all supposed to work. I'm shooting for a 90%+ in this class.</div>
